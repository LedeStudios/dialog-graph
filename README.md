# Project Introduction
`Dialog-Graph` is a plugin designed to help you easily implement dialogue systems in Unreal Engine 5. 
By utilizing a node-based editing system similar to Blueprints, Dialog-Graph allows users to intuitively design dialogue sequences. 
This plugin is ideal for creating dynamic dialogues in NPC interactions, quest lines, and other scenarios that require dialogue presentation.
